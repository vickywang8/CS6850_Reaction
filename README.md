The algorithm in voterank.py is inspired by Zhang et al.'s paper "Identifying a set of influential spreaders in complex networks." Scientific reports 6 (2016): 27823.
We also used the Condensed Matter (COND-MAT) dataset from Leskovec et al.'s work "Graph evolution: Densification and shrinking diameters." ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD) 1.1 (2007): 2.
